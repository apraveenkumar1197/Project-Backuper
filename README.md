# Project-Backuper
Ha Documentation ðŸ˜’ I hate it too, Just make quite simple.
Project contains 3 Files
1. configurer.php - Web Console (Add Projects,Delete projects,Logging Configurations,Backup path updating)
2. backuper.json - saves all configuration (Simple DB ðŸ˜‰)
3. praveen_backuper.php - core file, reads config.json file, archives with simple compression techniques

Works well with Xampp VC11 PHP 5.6 (Tested in Windows Platform)
Note :- These stuffs may not be helpful for Pros, Hence it is a simple console
Since I am IT worker, It's easy for daily backups on multiple projects with single click  ðŸ˜Ž 
Needed help for Linux, Kindly ping me
