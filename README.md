# Project-Backuper
Ha Documentation ðŸ˜’ I hate it too, Just make quite simple.
Project contains 3 Files
1. setup.php - Web Console (Add,Edit,Delete projects,project saving location and additional customisation)
2. config.json - saves all configuration (Simple DB ðŸ˜‰)
3. backuper.php - core file, reads config.json file, archives with simple compression techniques

Works well with Xampp VC11 PHP 5.6
Note :- These stuffs are not for Pros, only for beginners
Since I am IT worker, It's easy for daily backups on multiple projects with single click  ðŸ˜Ž
